ok schema:

CREATE TABLE chalk (
    chalk_instance_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    quote_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    is_dropped BOOL NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (chalk_instance_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (quote_id) REFERENCES quote (quote_id)
);

CREATE TABLE quote (
    quote_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    author_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    quote TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_chalk_instance BOOL NOT NULL,
    is_action BOOL NOT NULL,
    timestamp TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (quote_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES author (author_id)
);

CREATE TABLE action (
    action_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (action_id)
);

CREATE TABLE author (
    author_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (author_id)
);


Get all quotes:

Dropped chalk quotes:
SELECT quote FROM quotes WHERE quote_id IN (SELECT quote_id FROM chalk WHILE is_dropped = 1;)

Video clips

6/16/24:
    Attempted to insert embedded video for each quote with a timestamp.
    Was able to include links to the beginning of video but not at specific time.
    Tried setting each quote as a link to seperate youtube video except video did 
    not open when clicked. 

    Future:
        
        
        When author button pressed, menue of different options shows up
        pertaining to the quote topic (chalk, video).
        
        Added form to easily insert in database new authors and quotes.
        
        Front page /quotes functionality

6/17/24
    Created youtube clips from all of the moments with timestamps. Only the videos
    with timestamps have these links.

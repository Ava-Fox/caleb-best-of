### Hey

This is a collection of quotes I found to bring me absolute delight while watching [Caleb Curry's 8 hour compilation video series on database design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0j0QN2b57M&t=0h0m0s). I thought it proper to just store it in a database itself. I'd been casually collecting these quotes while following along, and got the idea to create a database 7 hours in, so timestamps are only available for quotes collected during the last hour. I highly reccomend just clicking through for a good laugh. Caleb, if you're watching this: please marry me I love you ðŸ’•

###### Ideas:
    - [x] Bouncing head lol
    - [ ] Create a password login for something only he would know and upon entry I give him my contact info and social security number (for the marriage contract)
        - COntact info is accessed via database download 
            - table full of info
            - [ ] talk to someone who actually knows security 
                - fake SSN lol 0000-00000-000000...
    - [ ] add image of him holding sword as cursor, where the tip of sword is where click
    - [ ] Chrome extension where it will sometimes (1/10 times?) open to a random best-of timestamp moment ( thx Emily this is a good one <3 )
    - [ ] Navbar Left side of screen:
        - [ ] Author
            - [ ] Al
                - [ ] The one Al quote
            - [ ] Caleb

                    - All ones in chalk table
                - [ ] Video clips
                    - If timestamps
    - [ ] SQL

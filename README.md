### Hey

This is a collection of quotes I found to bring me absolute delight while watching [Caleb Curry's 8 hour compilation video series on database design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0j0QN2b57M&t=0h0m0s). I thought it proper to just store it in a database itself. I'd been casually collecting these quotes while following along, and got the idea to create a database 7 hours in, so timestamps are only available for quotes collected during the last hour. I highly reccomend just clicking through for a good laugh. Caleb, if you're watching this: please marry me I love you ðŸ’•
